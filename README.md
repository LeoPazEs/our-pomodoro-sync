# Our Pomodoro: A Synchronized Pomodoro Timer

"our-pomodoro" is a real-time, synchronized Pomodoro timer designed for teams and collaborative work sessions. This project is a hands-on exercise to learn and implement Golang for backend development, with a special focus on WebSockets for real-time communication and an eventual goal of using binary formats for data efficiency.

## How It Works

When one user in a session starts, stops, or resets the timer, the action is instantly broadcast to every other user in the same session. This ensures the entire team is synchronized, whether they are in a deep work phase or on a break.

## Inspiration

This project is born from a desire to build a practical tool for collaborative productivity while simultaneously undertaking a deep dive into modern backend development with Golang.
